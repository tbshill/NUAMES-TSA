I dicided to put all of the CSS in one folder. It makes copy and pasting easier. The nameing scheme is PageCSS.css. Notice tha the "p" in Page is capitalized.

There are several exteranl CSS files that I include on the index page. These are usually going to be fonts, however, Twitter Bootstrap is included there as well.
