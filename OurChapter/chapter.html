                    <h2>Creed</h2>
                    <p>I believe that Technology Education holds an important place
                        in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the
                        development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials,
                        experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers,
                        artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my
                        best in making my school, community, state, and nation better
                        places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine.
                        I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will
                        explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and
                        living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise
                        tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands
                        and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will
                        make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be
                        steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.</p>
