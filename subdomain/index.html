<h1>E-Waste</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste</h2>
<p>An estimated 50 million tons of E-waste are produced each year.[1] The USA discards 30 million computers each year and 100 million phones are disposed of in Europe each year. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that only 15-20% of e-waste is recycled, the rest of these electronics go directly into landfills and incinerators</p>

<p>80 to 85% of electronic products were discarded in landfills or incinerators, which can release certain toxics into the air.
E-waste represents 2% of America's trash in landfills, but it equals 70% of overall toxic waste. The extreme amount of lead in electronics alone causes damage in the central and peripheral nervous systems, the blood and the kidneys.
20 to 50 million metric tons of e-waste are disposed worldwide every year.
Cell phones and other electronic items contain high amounts of precious metals like gold or silver. Americans dump phones containing over $60 million in gold/silver every year.
Only 12.5% of e-waste is currently recycled.
